# Accordion

<Description of={Accordion} />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Accordion } from 'radiance-ui';
```

<ArgsTable of={Accordion} />

### Standard Accordion

Basic accordion styling, contains standard border, shadow and padding.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AccordionStories.StandardAccordion} />
</Canvas>

### Accordion - No Border

This accordion style permits usage without the border typically found on the accordion

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AccordionStories.NoBorderAccordion} />
</Canvas>

### Disabled Accordion

The disabled accordion should only be used when the user is taking a clearly defined action in a series of tasks. A good example of this component is the photo uploader in the sign up flow. Accordion blocks which represent specific photos the user takes, remain disabled and closed until the respective steps are reached. The user is then auto-advanced through each accordion block.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AccordionStories.DisabledAccordion} />
</Canvas>

### Right-aligned Arrow Accordion

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AccordionStories.RightAlignedArrowAccordion} />
</Canvas>

### With Controls (use Knobs addon)

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AccordionStories.WithControls} />
</Canvas>

## Subcomponents

The `<Accordion />` component has subcomponents available through dot notation.

### Accordion with Thumbnails

The accordion style renders thumbnail images into the right hand side of the accordion header title bar. These thumbnail images represent images actually found in the `content` section of the accordion.

- **1 image:** Renders thumbnail of image

- **2 images:** Renders thumbnails of both images

- **3+ images:** Renders thumbnail of first image and a counter of additional images

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AccordionStories.ThumbnailsAccordion} />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Accordion.Thumbnails} />

### Container

Container to hold instances of `<Accordion>`

<Canvas>
  <Accordion.Container>
    <Accordion
      title={
        <Accordion.Content>
          This Accordion styled with an Accordion.Container parent component
        </Accordion.Content>
      }
      isOpen
    >
      <Accordion.Content>
        This Accordion styled with an Accordion.Container parent component
      </Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion>
  </Accordion.Container>
</Canvas>

### Content

Wraps padding around children nodes

<Canvas>
  <Accordion.Container>
    <Accordion title={<Accordion.Content>Title</Accordion.Content>}>
      <Accordion.Content>Expansion with content padding</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion
      title={<Accordion.Content>Title (open)</Accordion.Content>}
      isOpen
    >
      <Accordion.Content>Expansion with content padding</Accordion.Content>
    </Accordion>
  </Accordion.Container>
</Canvas>

### Truncate

Prevents line-wrapping and shortens text with an ellipsis. Note: The ellipsis will only
be added if the text is a direct child.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={AccordionStories.TruncatedAccordion} />
</Canvas>
