### Usage

```jsx

<Container>
  Content goes here!
</Container>
```

<!-- STORY -->

### Notes
The `<Container />` component is mainly useful for base styles. As we continue define this component through our design system we can make these more opinionated (ie adding spacing, accents, etc). Currently these are only styled for background, border and box-shadow.
