      relevant information, such as your credit card number and its expiration
      date, your billing address and your shipping information. You represent
      and warrant that you have the right to use any credit card or other
      payment information that you submit in connection with a Transaction. By

    <h2>20. Governing Law; Arbitration</h2>
    <p>
      The terms of this Agreement are governed by the laws of the United States
      (including federal arbitration law) and the State of California, U.S.A.,
      without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of
      your location.{' '}
      <em>
        Except for disputes that qualify for small claims court, all disputes
        arising out of or related to this Agreement or any aspect of the
        relationship between you and Company, whether based in contract, tort,
        statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, will be
        resolved through final and binding arbitration before a neutral
        arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury and you agree that
        Company and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury. Except as
        provided below regarding the class action waiver, such disputes include,
        without limitation, disputes arising out of or relating to
        interpretation or application of this arbitration provision, including
        the enforceability, revocability or validity of the arbitration
        provision or any portion of the arbitration provision. All such matters
        shall be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        You agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on
        an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not
        permitted and you are agreeing to give up the ability to participate in
        a class action.
      </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
      Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this
      Agreement. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at{' '}

      </a>
      . The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or
      videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the
      arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person
      hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a
      location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due
      consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
      circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such
      determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The
      arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of this Agreement and will be
      final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary,
      interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific
      performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide
      relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award
      rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court
      having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing
      in this Agreement will preclude you from bringing issues to the attention
      of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek
      relief against us for you.

    <h2>23. Copyright Infringement Claims</h2>
    <p>
      The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides
      recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the
      Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe
      in good faith that materials available on the Website infringe your
      copyright, you (or your agent) may send to Company a written notice by
      mail, e-mail or fax, requesting that Company remove such material or block
      access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed
      a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to
      send to Company a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet
      the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See{' '}

      If you are a consumer residing in New Jersey, the following provisions of

      may have) to the extent they are unenforceable under New Jersey law: (a)
      the disclaimer of liability for any indirect, incidental, consequential,
      special, exemplary or punitive damages of any kind (for example, to the

      Products Liability Act, New Jersey Uniform Commercial Code and New Jersey
      Consumer Fraud Act); (b) the limitation on liability for loss of profits
      or loss or use of data (for example, to the extent unenforceable under the

      Act); (c) application of the limitations of liability to the recovery of
      damages that arise under any contract, tort (including negligence), strict
      liability or any other theory (for example, to the extent such damages are
      recoverable by a consumer under New Jersey law, including the New Jersey
      Products Liability Act); (d) the requirement that you indemnity Company
      (for example, to the extent the scope of such indemnity is prohibited
      under New Jersey law); and (e) the California governing law provision (for
      example, to the extent that your rights as a consumer residing in New
      Jersey are required to be governed by New Jersey law).

    <h2>26. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>
      This Agreement does not, and shall not be construed to, create any
      partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or
      franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and Company. If any
      provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any
      reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from this
      Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any
      remaining provision. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all
      of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express
      prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of

      No waiver by either party of any breach or default under this Agreement
      will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or
      default. Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is for
      convenience only, and in no way defines or explains any section or
      provision. All terms defined in the singular shall have the same meanings
      when used in the plural, where appropriate and unless otherwise specified.
      Any use of the term “including” or variations thereof in this Agreement
      shall be construed as if followed by the phrase “without limitation.” To
      the extent there is a conflict between the provisions in this Agreement
      and any Additional Terms incorporated herein by reference, the latter
      shall have precedence. This Agreement, including any terms and conditions
      incorporated herein, is the entire agreement between you and Company
      relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior or
      contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings between you
      and Company relating to such subject matter. Notices to you (including
      notices of changes to this Agreement) may be made via posting to the
      Website or by e-mail (including in each case via links), or by regular

      administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the
      same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents
      and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Company
      will not be responsible for any failure to fulfill any obligation due to
      any cause beyond its control.
